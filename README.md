# StudySync

StudySync was born from my own struggles as a high school student in 2025. Juggling multiple subjects, assignments, and study groups, I found myself overwhelmed with scattered notes, missed deadlines, and inefficient study sessions. I needed a solution that wasn't just another generic calendar app â€“ I needed something built by a student, for students.
This platform brings together everything I wished I had: smart time management, collaborative study tools, and progress tracking that actually makes sense for high schoolers. As my first major coding project at age 17, StudySync represents both my technical journey in web development and my commitment to solving real problems faced by students like me.

Key Features:

Track assignments and progress across all subjects in one place
Organize study groups and share resources easily
Monitor study time and set achievable goals
Get a clear view of upcoming deadlines and tasks

Built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies, this project showcases my growing skills in software development while addressing the daily challenges of student life.
